## Description

This web application checks a user's input to determine if it's an anagram or an antigram.

## Specifications

| Behavior | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| The program will verify that two words are anagrams  | "listen", "silent" | "Cool, your words are anagrams!" |
| The program will ignore letter case | "Team", "Meat" | "Cool, your words are anagrams!" |

| After verifying two words are in fact anagrams, the program will verify that the word(s) are a palindrome | "Top", "spot" | "Guess what, your words are also a palindrome!" |
| The program will verify the user's input is a valid word by checking the presence of vowel and notify the user if not valid | "qwrty lmp" | "I don't think that's a word you silly mongoose... try again!" |
| The program will check to see if the user's input is an "antigram", if not already found to be an anagram, by verifying that all letters in each word are different than the letters in each other word | "mango", "butter" | "Woah, your 2 words are antigrams!" |
| The program will also perform these verify anagram and antigram conditions for multiple words as input | "Punishments", "Nine Thumps" | "That's an impressive anagram!" |
